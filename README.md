nodejs-socketio-sample
============

This is a simple vanilla JS [socket.io](https://socket.io) project based on the [chat tutorial](https://socket.io/get-started/chat).

# Motivation

I have a few `React` project ideas that might benefit using `web socket` so I have been wanting to try `socket.io`.
But before that, I need to get to know and learn the intricacies of `socket.io` hence I am using vanilla JS for this project as an exercise.

> Note: Currently, the project works but this is a work in progress. The UI components are mostly unstyled and are still bare essentials

# Getting Started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/supershaneski/nodejs-socketio-sample.git myproject

$ cd myproject

Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000/` to load the client page
